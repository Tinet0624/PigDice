# PigDice
## How it works now
Pig dice is working at its base levels but needs work. Right now the game continues even after someone wins.
## Improvements to be made
* need a "new game" button to be reset after someone wins.
* need to lock roll and pass button after win condition is met.
* would like to display the name of the winner in a modal instead of where its displayed right now.
